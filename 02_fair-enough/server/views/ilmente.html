    I'm <em>Alessandro Bellini</em>, a geek who loves frontend coding, taking photographs here and there, 
    cooking and eating, singing out loud (even in my office, when alone) and playing bass guitar, dancing 
    like a fool, watching great animes, reading newspapers, having ideas and knowing what I'm speaking about, 
    travelling, matching with people, discovering new things and being happy.
